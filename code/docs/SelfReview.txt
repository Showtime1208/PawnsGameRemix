Design Reflections & Lessons Learned
Reflecting on this project, the main element I would change in my own
design is making the view less complex and component-heavy from the start.
While everything worked fine in the end, a more streamlined view would have further
simplified integration for other teams. Even so, I learned an important lesson: even
when designs differ significantly, a well-structured adapter can bridge the gap.
Seeing how easily the provider’s code fit into our model and controller logic
underscored how flexible interfaces and good abstraction principles can save a
lot of time and effort.

Experience with the Provider and Customer Teams
I had a very smooth experience with both my provider and customer teams.
My customers didn’t need any additional support, as our code appears to have
integrated smoothly into their systems without questions. On the provider side,
the only real assistance I needed was some missing documentation, which they promptly
provided. Communication was minimal but effective, and it highlighted how even small
clarifications can prevent confusion and speed up the integration process. Overall,
the collaboration was easy, and I feel more confident in designing interfaces that
accommodate different implementations going forward.
