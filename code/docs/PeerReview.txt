Design Critique
The overall design of the code was clear and easy to integrate.
The interfaces were particularly flexible, allowing us to plug in our own model
and controllers without having to rewrite large sections of their code.
This indicates thoughtful architecture and an understanding that other
groups might rely on those interfaces. The logical separation between
the model interfaces and the view classes was especially helpful, as we
could focus on hooking up our model without worrying about how everything
was laid out.

Implementation Critique
Implementation details were mostly well thought out. Their view code,
in particular, was straightforward to adapt, requiring only a small
number of adjustments or adapter methods on our end. The code’s overall
structure also made it easy to locate relevant classes and interfaces.
One area that could be improved is the resizing logic: when the window
size changes, the interface currently clips the view instead of resizing
it smoothly. It would be beneficial to implement some logic that
recalculates component sizes or uses a more dynamic layout.

Documentation Critique
The documentation was concise but effective.
Even though not every method was explained in-depth,
the comments that were provided helped us quickly grasp
how to connect our model to their view. We also appreciated
that they included short summaries at the top of their classes,
explaining each class’s purpose. More thorough Javadoc or additional
diagrams could further strengthen the documentation, but in general,
it was sufficient for our needs.

Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions
The main limitation we found was the lack of a robust resizing
mechanism in the GUI. If the window is resized to be too small,
part of the interface is simply cut off, which affects the usability
for end-users. Implementing a logical view would allow the interface to adapt easily
to different window sizes. Otherwise, their code was well structured, easy to
adapt, and offered us a solid foundation for our own integration efforts.
