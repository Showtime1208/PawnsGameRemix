 * Abstract base implementation of the read-only game model.

 * Intended to be extended by concrete models that introduce state mutations.

 * Fields:
 * - {@code board}: the current game board (grid of tiles)
 * - {@code redPlayer}: reference to the red-side player
 * - {@code bluePlayer}: reference to the blue-side player
 * - {@code currentPlayer}: the player whose turn is active
